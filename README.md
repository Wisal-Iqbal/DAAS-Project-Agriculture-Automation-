# DAAS-Project-Agriculture-Automation-
Agriculture faces labor shortages, climate stress, and scalability limits. We propose a decentralized edge-AI robotic framework using federated learning and multi-agent coordination for real-time farm automation. It achieves 96.1% detection accuracy, sub-50 ms latency, 40% lower energy use, and resilience to 33% node failure.
